*** behaviorspace_csv_handling.R instructions ***

The "behaviorspace_csv_handling.R" script contains some simple code that transforms the ckv files that Netlogo's behaviorspace generates into a dataframe that lends itself for building visualisations with ggplot and/or plotly. 

The script was originally built to create visuals for combinations of:
- individual agents
- metrics (agent values to be precise)
- time series (ticks)
- comparing simulation runs (runs)
